# Destiny Gear Vendor

This project is a CLI and webservice for converting Bungie's 3D models from their own format to a more open format.
Specifically USDZ, Collada, and STL are currently formatted but not tested thoroughly. An example gallery of the USDZ
models can be found here: https://warmind.network/usdz-cache/
